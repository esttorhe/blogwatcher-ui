## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| User authentication | Single user, local access only |
| Labels/tags | Not needed, adds complexity |
| In-app reader view | Just link to originals, avoids content fetching |
| Auto-sync/background refresh | Manual only keeps it simple |
| Full-text search | Would require fetching/storing article content |
| Read time estimates | Not in current database schema |
| Keyboard shortcuts | Nice to have but not essential |
| OPML import/export | Deferred to future milestone |
| Scrape-based blogs | RSS/Atom only for v1.2 |
